# Resources
1) https://www.learncpp.com/
This is the most useful resource. Even if you are not a c++ developer, you should read it
because it has the base, fundamentals of programming and OOP. Even if you are codding on high-level language, you still should learn how low level works. That is what i think
2) https://javascript.info/
As I am a javascript node.js developer, this is the best resource about javascript.
3) https://www.patterns.dev/posts/classic-design-patterns/
